<h1>This is me!!</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Swastika, currently a second-year undergraduate student pursuing Mechanical Engineering at IIT BHU. Over the past two years, I’ve had the chance to explore the fundamentals of engineering through courses like Mechanics of Deformable Solids, Kinematics of Machines, Machine Tools, and C programming. These subjects have helped me develop a strong analytical mindset and problem-solving skills that I’m now channeling toward something I’m deeply passionate about—software development.
</p>

<p>While I’ve always been fascinated by how mechanical systems work, I realized that I’m equally drawn to the logic and creativity involved in coding. That’s when I began actively building my technical skills beyond the classroom—learning programming languages, working on small personal projects, and diving into areas like software engineering. My long-term goal is to become a Software Development Engineer, and I’m working steadily to make that happen.</p>

<p>Alongside my technical journey, I’ve also been nurturing a creative side through freelancing. I enjoy writing, particularly in areas like copywriting and scriptwriting. These experiences have not only improved my communication skills but also taught me how to express ideas clearly and persuasively—something that’s been incredibly useful in both academic and team settings.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m someone who loves learning and building—whether it’s machines, code, or ideas. I enjoy solving problems, exploring new perspectives, and stepping out of my comfort zone. I’m excited about where this journey is taking me, and I’m always looking for new opportunities to grow, contribute, and create something meaningful.</p>
